# Tumble
Tumble follows the theoretical path of a virtual tumbleweed using real-time weather data.

The end product planned for this project is an interactive artwork combining the theoretical tracking with a physical component, consisting of a display of the current whereabouts of the virtual tumbleweed, as well as a dynamically mounted real-life tumbleweed, programmed to spin in accordance with it's virtual counterpart.

Live weather data is sourced from openweathermaps.org.
